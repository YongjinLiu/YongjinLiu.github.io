Abstract: With the widespread development of digital technology, individualsâ€™ daily activities are inseparable from interaction with electronic devices. Researchers have become interested in developing novel methods, to enable users to experience social and emotional satisfaction that traditional face-to-face interaction provides. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based pipeline to generate virtual digital humans for customer service industry. Specifically, we propose a method to construct a database with template service actions. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage method for generating 2D virtual human videos with gestures and emotional lip-sync expressions. We have conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments on the proposed 2D virtual human video generation method. The results demonstrate that the method effectively generates high-quality virtual digital humans for the customer service industry.
