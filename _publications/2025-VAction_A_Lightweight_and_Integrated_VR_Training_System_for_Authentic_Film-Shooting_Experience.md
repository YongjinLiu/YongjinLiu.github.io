Abstract: The film industry exerts significant economic and cultural influence, and its rapid development is contingent upon the expertise of industry professionals, underscoring the critical importance of film-shooting education. However, this process typically necessitates multiple practice in complex professional venues using expensive equipment, presenting a significant obstacle for ordinary learners who struggle to access such training environments. Despite VR technology has already shown its potential in education, existing research has not addressed the crucial learning component of replicating the shooting process. Moreover, the limited functionality of traditional controllers hinder the fulfillment of the educational requirements. Therefore, we developed VAction VR system, combining high-fidelity virtual environments with a custom-designed controller to simulate the real-world camera operation experience. The systemâ€™s lightweight design ensures cost-effective and efficient deployment. Experiment results demonstrated that VAction significantly outperforms traditional methods in both practice effectiveness and user experience, indicating its potential and usefulness in film-shooting education.
