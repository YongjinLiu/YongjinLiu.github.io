Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction is essential in forensic science and has widespread applications. It is challenging due to the detailed facial geometry, complex skull topology, and nonlinear skull-face relationship. We propose a novel approach for 3D craniofacial reconstruction using a Siamese cycle attention mechanism within Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Benefiting from the cycle attention mechanism, our method focuses on high-frequency features and morphological connections between the skull and face. Additionally, a Siamese network preserves its identity consistently. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior accuracy and high-quality details of our approach.
