Abstract: Hanfu, which embodies the exceptional artistry of dying, weaving, and embroidery, is the emblematic traditional garment of Han nationality in China. However, there is a lack of convenient and immersive promotion methods for Hanfu. In this paper, we presented a virtual reality system focusing on the "Cross-Shaped Flat Structure", which is an integral feature of Hanfu. We restore five representative Hanfu historical artifacts and provide an interactive Hanfu making experience. Combined with highly realistic cloth simulation techniques, it allows users to interactively observe the movement effects of the Hanfu. The user experiment results show that our system can provide a favorable experience for users and bring a better learning effect, which helps users to enhance their interest in learning and thus contributes to the inheritance of Hanfu culture.
