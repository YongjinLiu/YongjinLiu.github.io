Abstract: Hanfu is the representative traditional costume of Han nationality in China, which carries the outstanding craftsmanship of dyeing, weaving, and embroidery, and is of great significance to the inheritance of traditional culture. However, the existing methods of Hanfu publicity still have problems, which are not conducive to the inheritance of Hanfu culture. In this work, we developed the VisHanfu virtual reality system by focusing on the "Cross-Shaped Flat Structure", which is an integral feature of Hanfu. We have digitally restored twenty-five representative Hanfu historical artifacts and provided an interactive making experience. Combined with high realistic cloth simulation techniques, it allows users to interactively observe the movement effects of the Hanfu. The results of user studies demonstrates that our system can provide a favorable experience for users, and bring a better learning effect, which helps users to enhance their interest in learning and thus contributes to the inheritance of Hanfu culture.
