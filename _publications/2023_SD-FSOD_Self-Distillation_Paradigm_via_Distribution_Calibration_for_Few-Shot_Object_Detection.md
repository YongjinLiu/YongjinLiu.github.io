Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect novel targets with only a few instances of the associated samples. Although combinations of distillation techniques and meta-learning paradigms have been acknowledged as the primary strategies for FSOD tasks, the existing distillation methods exhibit inherent biases and sensitivity to novel class variability. A critical hurdle for FSOD distillation is the difficulty in ensuring appropriate knowledge learned from the teacher model during the fine-tuning stage. Furthermore, coarse distillation procedures risk misalignment between the learned and actual distributions. This misalignment could potentially negate the benefits of positive cases and impede the detectorâ€™s evolution. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel self-distillation paradigm exclusively for the fine-tuning stage (SD-FSOD). Our methods integrate a Distribution Prototype Extractor (DPE) and Self-Distillation Memory (SDM), promoting feature distribution consistency during distillation. In detail, the DPE module reliably initializes the weights of the detector, ensuring a robust class distribution for the distillation process. Meanwhile, the SDM module utilizes decoupling techniques to divide the distillation tasks into two sub-task branches, allowing the student model to independently learn and share precise features through isolated distillation processes. The synergistic integration of feature calibration techniques and the continuous self-distillation paradigm distinctly enhances the fine-tuning process, which shows the superiority of the FSOD self-distillation methodologies. The extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach produces significant improvements and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.
