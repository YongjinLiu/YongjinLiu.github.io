Abstract:  Empathy and identity recognition are two core social interaction factors that greatly affect efficiency and effectiveness. The selection of a profile picture in social media is crucial as it serves as a visual representation of virtual identity. It not only reflects the user's personality but also influences the level of empathy and identification that others feel toward them. However, the potential impact of profile pictures with different styles (e.g., real faces, cartoon faces, and landscape images) on empathy and identity recognition is still unclear. To explore its effects, a controlled laboratory experiment and an ecological online experiment were conducted. Participants were shown a picture each time, informed to imagine interacting with the person using it as his/her profile picture, and instructed to rate an item from the basic empathy scale (BES) based on it. After rating all pictures, users then completed an identity recognition task. Results show that participants' empathy scores for users with cartoon or real face profile pictures are greater than those with landscape profile pictures. In addition, participants performed better in identity recognition for users with real face or landscape images as profile pictures than for those with cartoon face profile pictures. Moreover, users of social media often make social categorizations (i.e., in-group/out-group categorization) based on the social identities expressed by their profile pictures. Our results also indicate that the affective empathy scale rating score was positively associated with the degree to which users of the corresponding profile pictures were categorized as in-group members.
