Abstract: Plant sensors are commonly used in agricultural production, landscaping, and other fields to monitor plant growth and environmental parameters. As an important basic parameter in plant monitoring, leaf inclination angle (LIA) not only influences light absorption and pesticide loss but also contributes to genetic analysis and other plant phenotypic data collection. The measurements of LIA provide a basis for crop research as well as agricultural management, such as water loss, pesticide absorption, and illumination radiation. On the one hand, existing efficient solutions, represented by light detection and ranging (LiDAR), can provide the average leaf angle distribution of a plot. On the other hand, the labor-intensive schemes represented by hand measurements can show high accuracy. However, the existing methods suffer from low automation and weak leaf–plant correlation, limiting the application of individual plant leaf phenotypes. To improve the efficiency of LIA measurement and provide the correlation between leaf and plant, we design an image-phenotype-based noninvasive and efficient optical sensor measurement system, which combines multi-processes implemented via computer vision technologies and RGB images collected by physical sensing devices. Specifically, we utilize object detection to associate leaves with plants and adopt 3-dimensional reconstruction techniques to recover the spatial information of leaves in computational space. Then, we propose a spatial continuity-based segmentation algorithm combined with a graphical operation to implement the extraction of leaf key points. Finally, we seek the connection between the computational space and the actual physical space and put forward a method of leaf transformation to realize the localization and recovery of the LIA in physical space. Overall, our solution is characterized by noninvasiveness, full-process automation, and strong leaf–plant correlation, which enables efficient measurements at low cost. In this study, we validate Auto-LIA for practicality and compare the accuracy with the best solution that is acquired with an expensive and invasive LiDAR device. Our solution demonstrates its competitiveness and usability at a much lower equipment cost, with an accuracy of only 2. 5° less than that of the widely used LiDAR. As an intelligent processing system for plant sensor signals, Auto-LIA provides fully automated measurement of LIA, improving the monitoring of plant physiological information for plant protection. We make our code and data publicly available at http://autolia.samlab.cn.
